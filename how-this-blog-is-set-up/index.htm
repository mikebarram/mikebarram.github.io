            <p>The hosting, as you can see from the URL, is on github.io - <a href="javascript:if(confirm('https://pages.github.com/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed using an unsupported protocol (e.g., gopher).  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='https://pages.github.com/'" tppabs="https://pages.github.com/">how to publish a site under github.io</a></p>

<p>So, following that guide, I managed to create a simple home page. As github.io doesn't allow server side code for templating a site, I wanted a CMS / blogging tool that would help me manage content, wrap it in a template and produce a static site that could be synced to GitHub. By looking at what other people used, I picked <a href="javascript:if(confirm('https://ghost.org/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed using an unsupported protocol (e.g., gopher).  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='https://ghost.org/'" tppabs="https://ghost.org/">ghost</a> but not the hosted version. Instead I picked the <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://support.ghost.org/installing-ghost-windows/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://support.ghost.org/installing-ghost-windows/'" tppabs="http://support.ghost.org/installing-ghost-windows/">version you download and install on Windows</a>. This involved <a href="javascript:if(confirm('https://nodejs.org/en/download/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed using an unsupported protocol (e.g., gopher).  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='https://nodejs.org/en/download/'" tppabs="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">installing Node.js</a> along the way.</p>

<p>Finally, there's the matter of syncing the content from Ghost to GitHub... <br />
The tricky bit is that Ghost doesn't publish the content to a set of static files. Instead, you need a tool that will spider the site and save the contents to the folder that is acting as your local GitHib repository. <br />
The standard tool in this situation, seems to be the python script buster <br />
